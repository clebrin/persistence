# Introduction

### What is a persistency technique ?
Once a flaw is detected in a system and that an attacker wants to exploit it with a malware, he must create the program, infect a device with it and make it execute. On of the main difficulties to achieve such a mission is to enter the device, it can be made throught different technics such as phishing, downloading a malicious file, insering a usb key etc... In order to keep the malware working on the machine after a reboot or a logout/login and avoid doing the "infection phase" again the attacker needs to implement technics that wake the malware up on at a certain point: the persistency techniques.

### What is a syscall trace ?
When a software or, here, a malware is executed on a device, it follows the instructions coded by the attacker and make different actions on the machine. For a some actions the program need to request a service from the kernel of the operating system, we call such actions "system calls". It is possible to monitor them and keep a "trace" of it during the execution of the malware.

### What does this program ?
This program aims to detect persistency techniques from syscall traces of a malware that ran on a windows OS.

# How it works ?

The syscall traces are saved in pickle files, I use a code from D.B. to load and parse them. Some of the most common persistency techniques are gathered in the MITRE ATT&CKÂ® base and other blogs describe the link between the techniques and the specific registry keys in windows.<br/>
I search in each trace if one of those keys have been modified.<br/>
Above is a list of techniques I detect and there link with the registry keys.

# Techniques

*`HKLM` stands for `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` and `HKCU` for `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`. I present the vulnerabilities in order of occurence in the boot sequence.*

### BootExecute

The very first program executed when rebooting a windows machine is the `autocheck autochk *` sequence located in the registry `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager`. It check the integrity of the file-system, if a program is added to this value it will be executed a boot time.

### Services

When the startup sequence starts, the system look for the needed drivers and this list is located in `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services`. This is the famous progress bar under the "Starting Windows..." but if one places his malicious software in the list, it will be executed at that time !

### Run Services

It then need to know where those needed drivers are located and this is store in the registries above : <br/>
`HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\Services\Once`<br/>
`HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\Services`

### WinLogon Userinit

This is the part where logons are logoffs are handled, normally it points to userinit.exe but if this key can be altered, then that exe will also launch by Winlogon.<br/>
`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon`

### WinLogon Notify

This process handles the Secure Attention Sequence (SAS) and the `WinLogon Notify` value is used to notify event handles when SAS happens and loads a process, if the attacker can choose the process list, it can launch his malware.<br/>
`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify`

### Run

This is probably the most commom persistency technique because those are the list of file with AutoStart Extension Points(ASEP) meaning that they will be launch automatically. If their exploit fails to obtain NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM or administrator-level rights they can always create a key under the "user" run keys and persist their access.<br/>
`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`<br/>
`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce`<br/>
`HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`<br/>
`HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce`

### AppInit

As most executables load User32.dll and `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Windows\AppInit_DLLs` show the DLLs loaded by the User32.dll so it is a good idea to keep an eye on this.

### Shell Folder

The following Registry keys can be used to set startup folder items for persistence:<br/>
`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserShell Folders`<br/>
`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ShellFolders`<br/>
`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ShellFolders`<br/>
`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserShellFolders`
